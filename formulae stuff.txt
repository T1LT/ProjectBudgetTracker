- take end date input
- calculate the months between
- divide the budget by months
- AC - actual cost = inc exp
- PV - planned value - comes from the monthly planned budget (assuming PV = EV)
- BAC - budget at completion - total budget
- EAC - estimate at completion
- VAC - variance at completion
- CV = EV - AC
- CPI = EV / AC
- EAC = BAC / CPI
- VAC = BAC - EAC

- if(CV < 0): project is overbudgetted
- if(CPI < 1): project budget is overrun


- ex: if PV = 1500, AC = 1400, BAC = 50000
then CV = 100, CPI = 1.07, EAC = 46,666.67, VAC = 3,333.33
